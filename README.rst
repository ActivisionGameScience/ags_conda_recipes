Motivation
==========

If you are developing in C, C++, or python then you should 
use ``conda`` (https://github.com/conda/conda.git) for your
package/dependency management.  For other languages you might consider it
as well.

To justify this, consider other package managers:

* python has ``pip`` + ``virtualenv``

* C/C++ has ``apt-get``, ``yum``, ``nuget``, ``homebrew``, etc

``pip`` works well if you are only dealing with pure python packages.  However,
many of the best python packages (e.g. ``numpy``) are written in C, and
``pip`` is not a good tool for managing native binaries.

System-level package managers like ``apt-get`` and ``yum`` work
much better with native binaries, but they have serious drawbacks of their own: 

1) need admin privileges to install packages (and changes are system-wide)

2) limited to packages that are available (and allowed by your IT department)

3) your builds will be tightly coupled to the platform 

4) every platform has its own package manager

5) how do you manage dependencies within your own codebase?

Point (2) is particularly nasty.  How many of us have been told that our deploy
environment is RHEL6 with python 2.6 and gcc 4.4 (or, worse, RHEL5)?  
Your favorite libraries will not be available.

Point (3) is ugly if you need to deploy across many
environments.  Maintaining Windows and Mac builds is hard enough.  
Do you want to maintain separate builds for RHEL5, RHEL6,
Ubuntu12.04, and Ubuntu14.04 as well?

Point (4) is a problem even for the Linux-only crowd.  Which distro?  

Point (1) is at least no longer a problem for Linux developers who
use ``docker``.  Unfortunately there
is not a similar solution for Windows and Mac projects.

The python world mitigated (1) with the introduction of ``virtualenv``.
Unfortunately this only works well for pure python code.


What is conda?
--------------

``conda`` keeps the good parts of these package managers
and jettisons the bad.  Like ``virtualenv``, ``conda`` avoids the 
system-wide trap through "environments".  No admin privileges are necessary.
Unlike ``virtualenv``, it can handle native packages as well.  

There is no reliance on platform-specific containers like ``docker`` or VMs.
The same system works *natively* on Linux, Windows, and Mac.

``conda``'s package repository (analogous to ``PyPI``) is called ``anaconda.org``
(formerly ``binstar``).  
``anaconda.org`` allows you to upload your own public and private packages, and
group yourselves into *organizations* (similar to how github works).

For proprietary packages (that cannot leave your firewall) you can maintain your
own package repository.  This can be as simple as a directory
containing tarballs.  The enterprisey solution is to purchase ``Anaconda Server`` from
Continuum Analytics (http://www.continuum.io).  If your needs are simple then we wrote a silly
"poor-man's Anaconda Server" https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/poboys_conda_package_server.git.

Finally, you can pull from several repositories simultaneously.  ``conda`` refers to
repositories as "package channels".


What is Anaconda?
-----------------

``Anaconda`` is a specific set of useful packages being
maintained by Continuum Analytics (http://www.continuum.io).  It is
free, but there are several add-on packages (``mkl``, ``iopro``, and ``accelerate``) 
that require a license.

The examples below build on top of non-free ``Anaconda``, but you don't
need to buy a license if you don't want to.  We will show you how to remove ``mkl``,
``iopro``, and ``accelerate`` if you don't need them.


About this tutorial
-------------------

This tutorial is an end-to-end example showing how to use ``conda`` in production.
We use it to manage both public packages (on ``anaconda.org``) and proprietary packages (behind our firewall).

We will use our own dev environment as a kitchen-sink example.  It is 
a mix of ``Anaconda`` packages and our own builds of popular software.  Anything not
pulled from the default channels will be pulled from our 
channel https://anaconda.org/ActivisionGameScience.  
You are invited to contribute to our environment, but otherwise you can use
it as an example.

Although ``Anaconda`` is fully cross-platform, 
our channel is lagging in Windows and Mac support (we are slowly working on it).
The techniques presented, however, will be nearly identical across all platforms.
It should take about 5 minutes to get going (followed by a 30-minute
nap while the packages download).

After briefly playing with our environment, we will describe how we created
it.  In particular, we will pick a package at random
and show how it was built (using a "recipe") and uploaded to ``anaconda.org``.

Finally, we will describe 3 example projects that we posted on github.  You
should pretend that these are your proprietary projects.  You will learn how to
build them and publish the packages behind your firewall.

Besides learning how to publish packages behind your firewall, you will
see that ``conda`` handles in-house dependencies in the same way that
it handles third-party dependencies.

As a bonus, we will demonsrate how to use ``cmake`` to build C++ projects,
and how to use ``cffi`` to create python wrappers around 
C/C++ libraries.


First steps: install conda
==========================

Before starting, find the most spartan machine possible.  Really annoy yourself.
A Windows or Mac box will work fine for now.  I started with this barebones CentOS5 vagrant box:  
http://tag1consulting.com/files/centos-5.9-x86-64-minimal.box.

It has no ``git`` and no ``java`` (let alone ``javac``, ``mvn``, or ``ant``).  
It doesn't even have ``vim``!  It's missing ``tmux`` and ``zsh``, 
and the system python is 2.4.  You can forget your favorite python libraries.
It doesn't have ``autotools`` (good luck building anything).

Let's turn this machine into a joy.  Download the ``Miniconda`` installer 
from http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html and run it.  In Linux:: 

    sh Miniconda-3.7.0-Linux_x86_64.sh

Mac is nearly identical::

    sh Miniconda-3.7.0-MacOSX_x86_64.sh

or in Windows::

    Miniconda-3.7.0-Windows_x86_64.exe

Feel free to use the python 3 installer (``Miniconda3-*``) instead if you have already made the switch.  Both ``Anaconda``
and our dev environment are up-to-date (we use python 3 more often, in fact).

Install it wherever you like (I chose ``~/miniconda`` for Linux and Mac and ``C:\miniconda`` for Windows).
You can allow the installer to permanently modify your ``PATH`` if you want.
If so then close and reopen your terminal.  
If not then you'll always have to enable ``conda`` manually.  In Linux or Mac::

    export PATH=~/miniconda/bin:$PATH

or in Windows::

    set PATH=C:\miniconda;%PATH% 

Either way, in Linux or Mac typing ``which python`` should show ``~/miniconda/bin/python`` 
(in Windows ``where python`` should show ``C:\miniconda\python.exe``).  
This is your "root" environment.

Only admin packages are allowed in the root environment.  Don't pollute
it with anything else.  Your real environments will live below the ``envs/`` subdirectory.

Now edit your ``~/.condarc`` file and add our channel and the default
channels::

    channels:
      - https://conda.anaconda.org/ActivisionGameScience
      - defaults

(in Windows your ``.condarc`` file lives in your home directory).

Remember that in YAML indents are 2 spaces (``conda`` will complain otherwise).  Since
our ActivisionGameScience channel is listed first, packages will be pulled from
there preferentially.

Now update everything in your root environment and install a couple of utility packages::

    conda update --all
    conda install jinja2 git conda-build anaconda-client

(in Windows and Mac please omit ``git`` because we do not have it packaged there yet).


Your first environment
----------------------

If you were in a hurry then you could create a full-fledged ``Anaconda`` environment (on any platform)
with the command::

    conda create -n myenv anaconda 

Instead, let's create a minimal environment containing only python and ``flask``::

    conda create -n myenv python flask

The new environment will be in the subdirectory ``envs/mydev/``.  You
can "activate" it like this (Linux or Mac)::

    source activate mydev

or in Windows::

    activate mydev

The new environment contains its own instance of python and ``flask``, i.e. the
following import should work::

    from flask import Flask 

It is easy to install more packages.  For example,
to install ``ipython`` from within an activated environment you would use the command::

    conda install ipython

Some environments can have hundreds of packages, so we
need a way to reproduce them exactly.
You can export the current environment to a text file::

    conda list --export > myenv.export

Then, from another machine, recreate the environment exactly::

    conda create -n myenv --file myenv.export

(note: export files will be platform-specific, i.e. a Windows export file
will not work on a Linux box).

Finally, in Linux or Mac you can deactivate the environment like this 
(this puts you back into the root environment)::

    source deactivate

or in Windows::

    deactivate


Try out our environment!  
------------------------

You are ready to try out our ActivisionGameScience dev environment.  Even if you
don't like it, it should give you an idea of the possibilities.

    Unfortunately, our dev environment only supports Linux currently.  However, the concepts
    translate to Windows and Mac with almost no change

Clone the current repository (that you are reading)::

    git clone https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/ags_conda_recipes.git

or, alternatively, just grab our latest exported file::

    ags_dev?-<latest version>-linux-64.export

This contains an exact specification of packages that we like.  Some of
them come from ``Anaconda``, but many of them come from our own channel.
Now you can create  your own ``agsdev`` environment (name it whatever
you want)::

    conda create -n agsdev --file agsdev?-<latest version>-linux-64.export

Go for a walk to let it download (takes about 30 minutes).
Future installs will be almost instantaneous because ``conda`` keeps
a cache of downloaded tarballs.

After your walk, check out the directory ``envs/agsdev/``.  There's your new
environment.

You can "activate" it like this::

    source activate agsdev

Go ahead, test some things out!  You'll notice that everything is
there that I complained about (``git``, ``cmake``, ``vim``, ``tmux``, ``zsh``,
``java``, ``javac``, ``ant``, ``mvn``, and much more!).


Remove licensed components if you don't need them
-------------------------------------------------

If you don't want to buy licenses then you need to remove the non-free packages::

    conda remove accelerate iopro mkl mkl-rt mkl-service mklfft numbapro cudatoolkit

You'll need a BLAS replacement for MKL, though::

    conda install openblas


How did we build and upload our packages to anaconda.org?
=========================================================

Now that you have our environment loaded and running, you
might want to know how we built it.

In order to build a package for ``conda`` you'll need to write
a "recipe".  Fortunately, some recipes are so trivial that they can be
auto-generated by ``conda`` (this is true for most packages in
``PyPI``).  For example, to generate a recipe for the library ``tweepy`` 
we use the following command::

    conda skeleton pypi tweepy

This creates a directory, ``tweepy/``, that contains
the following files::

    meta.yaml
    build.sh
    bld.bat

You should rename the directory to clarify the
version of the library that it builds (i.e. ``tweepy/`` becomes ``tweepy-2.3/``)
You can find the version in the ``meta.yaml`` file.

    Pro tip: for packages that link against ``numpy`` I have found it
    necessary to edit ``meta.yaml`` and pin the ``numpy`` version explicitly::
    
        - numpy 1.8.2
    
    then rename the directory to remind us that we pinned the version,
    i.e. ``gensim/`` becomes ``gensim-0.10.1-np18/``.

We are not so lucky with other packages (e.g. ``jdk`` and ``vim``).
Their recipes must be handwritten and often require 
considerable knowledge of various compilers (e.g. ``gcc``, ``clang``, ``cl``),
options, environment variables, and build
tools (e.g. ``cmake``, ``make``, ``nmake``, Visual Studio projects, etc).

Because of these difficulties, it is important for us to publish our
recipes and encourage pull requests.  Our goal is to
work together to build a comprehensive library of third-party packages.
We especially encourage adding Windows and Mac support.


Build and upload
----------------

*Make sure that you are in the root environment for this step*.  Do a ``source deactivate`` to
make sure.

You can build ``tweepy-2.3/`` with the following command (from one directory above)::

    conda build tweepy-2.3 

Assuming that everything built correctly there will now be a tarball in ``~/miniconda/conda-bld/linux-64/``
(or in similar directories for Mac and Windows).

    Pro tip: for packages that compile C/C++ code (including ``cython``), you should always build 
    with the oldest compiler possible (at least for gcc).  I use a RHEL5 box to
    build our packages because more modern versions of ``libc`` will be able to use those binaries
    (but not the other way around).

    Unfortunately, MSVC binaries are not always forward ABI compatible, so the same advice may
    not apply there

Since our organization on ``anaconda.org`` is called ``ActivisionGameScience`` I uploaded
the package with the following command::

    anaconda upload -u ActivisionGameScience ~/miniconda/conda-bld/linux-64/tweepy-2.3-py27.tar.bz2

Obviously I needed to input my personal credentials (and be a member of the ActivisionGameScience
organization).


How to manage your codebase with conda
======================================

The real power of ``conda`` manifests itself when you want to manage your own code.
Most shops (especially C/C++ groups) suffer from their own home-brewed Rube Goldberg
machines.

With ``conda`` we can escape this mess in a cross-platform manner.  You can
build code however you want, but use ``conda`` to handle the package and
dependency management.

    Pro tip: although you can build using ``autotools`` or whatever,
    we strongly suggest building C/C++ projects with ``cmake``, and python projects with
    ``setuptools``.  Combined with ``conda`` this gives a fully cross-platform
    solution that requires very little platform-specific code.


Project 1: a C++ wrapper library around c-blosc
-----------------------------------------------

Look at the repo https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/ags_example_cpp_lib.git.  This
is a dumb C++ wrapper around the popular ``c-blosc`` compression library.  You could
clone that repo and build it by hand using ``cmake`` (the README contains instructions).

However, we have written a conda recipe to handle it.  Clone the current repo (that you are reading)::

    git clone https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/ags_conda_recipes.git
    cd ags_conda_recipes

and build the recipe::

    conda build ags_example_cpp_lib-0.1.0

As always, when building packages, make sure that you have run ``source deactivate``
beforehand so that you are in the root environment.

What just happened?  This recipe created a sandbox environment, downloaded all
dependencies (``c-blosc`` and ``cmake`` are in our ActivisionGameScience channel), cloned ``ags_example_cpp_lib``
from github, ran ``cmake``, ran the C++ compiler, and then ran the installer.  Finally, it 
created a tarball from the installed files.

The new package is now in ``~/miniconda/conda-bld/linux-64/``.  Check out the README in
the https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/ags_example_cpp_lib.git to see what files
are included in the package.

Since we are pretending that this is your proprietary package, we do *not*
want to upload this to ``anaconda.org``.  We want
to publish the package to your own repository behind the firewall.
Let's see how to do this.


Behind-the-firewall conda repository
------------------------------------

We'll make the simplest conda repository possible: a directory of tarballs.  
If you need something enterprisey then consider purchasing ``Anaconda Server``.
If you need something in-between then look at our silly project
https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/poboys_conda_package_server.git.

First create some directory to hold your packages::

    mkdir /some/path/pkgs_inhouse

Then add it to your ``.condarc``::

    channels:
      - file:///some/path/pkgs_inhouse
      - https://conda.anaconda.org/ActivisionGameScience
      - defaults

Next add a platform subdirectory and copy your new package into it::

    mkdir /some/path/pkgs_inhouse/linux-64
    cp ~/miniconda/conda-bld/ags_example_cpp_lib-0.1.0.tar.bz2 /some/path/pkgs_inhouse/linux-64

Go into the platform subdirectory and index it (this must be repeated whenever adding a new package)::

    cd /some/path/pkgs_inhouse/linux-64
    conda index

We are done.  We can install the package in the usual ``conda`` way::

    conda install ags_example_cpp_lib

and remove it just as easily::

    conda remove ags_example_cpp_lib


How it works
++++++++++++

To see how ``conda`` handled the package management, it is easiest to start with the README in the
repo https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/ags_example_cpp_lib.git.

There you will find details describing how to build and install the library manually
using ``cmake``.  The most important thing to notice is that ``cmake``
needs ``c-blosc`` to be already installed.
The location is passed on the ``cmake`` command line using the
argument ``-DCBLOSC_ROOT=...``.

    For completeness, you should have a look at the ``cmake`` scripts::
    
        CMakeLists.txt
        cmake/Modules/FindCBLOSC.cmake
    
    to see how the headers and binaries are *actually* found (this is what
    the compiler wants).  ``cmake`` is the best tool for handling the build itself.

But how can we ensure that ``c-blosc`` will be installed?  For that matter,
how can we ensure that ``cmake`` will be installed?  

This is a dependency problem that is best left to ``conda``.
Look at the current repo (that you are reading now) in the directory
``ags_example_cpp_lib-0.1.0/``.  In ``meta.yaml`` you
will see that both ``cmake`` and ``c-blosc`` are listed as build
dependencies, and that ``c-blosc`` is repeated as a runtime dependency::

    requirements:
      build:
        - cmake
        - c-blosc

      run:
        - c-blosc

Fortunately, both ``cmake`` and ``c-blosc`` happen to be packages in
our ``anaconda.org`` channel https://conda.anaconda.org/ActivisionGameScience.  Hence
``conda`` will know how to install them before attempting a build
of ``ags_example_cpp_lib``.

    Aside: we wrote recipes for ``c-blosc`` and ``cmake`` as well.
    Look in their respective recipe directories ``c-blosc-1.5.2/`` and ``cmake-3.1.0/``
    at ``meta.yaml``.  You will see that ``c-blosc`` also
    uses ``cmake`` to build, but requires no further dependencies.
    ``cmake`` requires no dependencies.  We were able to add these packages
    to our channel by first building and uploading ``cmake``,
    then building and uploading ``c-blosc``.

Back in the recipe for ``ags_example_cpp_lib-0.1.0/``, 
look at the Linux/Mac build script ``build.sh``.
It contains the exact
``cmake`` commands that are described in the README::

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../ -DCBLOSC_ROOT=$PREFIX  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PREFIX

    make
    make install 

(``$PREFIX`` will be filled in by ``conda`` at build time).

So we see that ``cmake`` handles the build beautifully, and ``conda``
ensures that the necessary dependencies will be there when ``cmake``
goes looking for them.


Project 2: a C++ application using our library
----------------------------------------------

We can repeat this game with the repo
https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/ags_example_cpp_app.git.
This project builds two executables:
``ags_blosc_compress`` and ``ags_blosc_decompress``.  They are command-line
utilities that perform blosc compression/decompresson.

This project compiles against the library that we just built (``ags_example_cpp_lib``).

    Aside:  by transitivity it also links against ``c-blosc`` (but does not compile against it).
    We could've side-stepped this transitivity complication by having ``cmake`` build our
    library as a MODULE.  Modules are self-contained:  they have their
    dependencies linked in already.  To keep the example simple, however, I restrained myself to only
    STATIC and SHARED versions of the library.

As before, if you wanted then you could clone the repo and build it by hand using ``cmake`` (the README contains instructions).

Again, we have written a conda recipe to handle it.  Assuming that you already cloned this repo (that you are reading)::

    git clone https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/ags_conda_recipes.git
    cd ags_conda_recipes

you can build the package::

    conda build ags_example_cpp_app-0.1.0

(remember to run ``source deactivate`` beforehand so that you are in the root environment).

The new package is now in ``~/miniconda/conda-bld/linux-64/``.  Like before, you can put it
in your behind-the-firewall conda repository::

    cp ~/miniconda/conda-bld/ags_example_cpp_app-0.1.0.tar.bz2 /some/path/pkgs_inhouse/linux-64
    cd /some/path/pkgs_inhouse/linux-64
    conda index

I highly recommend that you read both the ``conda`` recipe and the ``cmake`` scripts to
understand how this build and dependency management worked.


Project 3: a python wrapper around our C++ library
--------------------------------------------------

We do the same thing with the repo 
https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/ags_example_py_wrapper.git.
This project installs a python module, ``ags_py_blosc_wrapper``,
that wraps our C++ library.  Look at the README for details how to
use it.

Since this is pure python (the binding is done via ``cffi``), no linking
is necessary.  There is no ``cmake`` because there is no C/C++ to build.  The
build is handled by ``setuptools``.

However, we need our C++ library to be available at runtime.
Again, ``conda`` handles this dependency.  Here is the relevant
section in ``ags_example_py_wrapper_0.1.0/meta.yaml``::

    requirements:
      build:
        - python
        - setuptools
    
      run:
        - python
        - numpy 1.8.2
        - cffi
        - ags_example_cpp_lib

Assuming you've already cloned this repo (that you are reading)::

    git clone https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/ags_conda_recipes.git
    cd ags_conda_recipes

you can build the package in seconds::

    conda build ags_example_py_wrapper-0.1.0

The new tarball, located in ``~/miniconda/conda-bld/linux-64/``, can be added to your 
behind-the-firewall conda repository like the others::

    cp ~/miniconda/conda-bld/ags_example_py_wrapper-0.1.0.tar.bz2 /some/path/pkgs_inhouse/linux-64
    cd /some/path/pkgs_inhouse/linux-64
    conda index

and installed the ``conda`` way::

    conda install ags_example_py_wrapper
    ipython
        In[0]: from ags_py_blosc_wrapper import BloscWrapper
        In[1]: b = BloscWrapper() 

        ...

See the README for usage instructions.
